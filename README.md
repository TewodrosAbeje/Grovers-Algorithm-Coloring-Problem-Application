# Grovers-Algorithm-Coloring-Problem-Application
Project title: 
  Grover’s algorithm for solving the graph coloring problem
  
Project description: 
  This project applies Grover’s quantum search algorithm to the graph coloring problem using the Four Color Theorem as a base. The goal is to count the number of valid colorings of a 8-node graph, where no two adjacent nodes share the same color. Each node is encoded using two qubits to allow four color states. Grover’s algorithm is used to amplify valid solutions, and the results are compared against classical brute-force search to evaluate performance differences. This simulation highlights how quantum algorithms can offer speedup in solving complex combinatorial problems relevant to  wireless networks.

How to clone and run the file: To run the graph coloring project using Grover’s algorithm, I use Visual Studio Code along with Python and Git. First, I clone the repository by opening VS Code, pressing Ctrl+Shift+P to open the Command Palette, and selecting “Git: Clone.” I paste the GitHub link for this project and choose a folder to save it. Once the cloning finishes, I click “Open” to load the project. Inside the project folder, you'll see three main Python files: week1_graph_encoding.py, week2_oracle_design.py, week3_grover_search.py and a README.md file with general info.To run the code, I open the terminal in VS Code specifically for week1_graph_encoding.py and click the play button in the top left corner. That file prints messages like "Hello grover", "The Coding School", and "Color Graph", which confirms the script is working. The other files have the same logic.
