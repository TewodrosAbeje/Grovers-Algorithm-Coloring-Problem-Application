# Grovers-Algorithm-Coloring-Problem-Application
Project title: 
  Grover’s algorithm for solving the graph coloring problem
  
Project description: 
  This project applies Grover’s quantum search algorithm to the graph coloring problem using the Four Color Theorem as a base. The goal is to count the number of valid colorings of a 5-node graph, where no two adjacent nodes share the same color. Each node is encoded using two qubits to allow four color states. Grover’s algorithm is used to amplify valid solutions, and the results are compared against classical brute-force search to evaluate performance differences. This simulation highlights how quantum algorithms can offer speedup in solving complex combinatorial problems relevant to scheduling, wireless networks, and more.
